# Project Background

A Vancouver-based Restaurant 'Red Ember House' relies on Online Ordering apps, such as UberEats and Doordash, for a significant portion of sales. However, a majority of customers never complete an order, and fall off at some point in the funnel. Using SQL and Tableau, I determine where the falloff happens in the funnel and what the causes are.

### Insights and Recommendations are made on the following areas:

- **Conversion Rate and Funnel Drop-Off**: Determining the Conversion Rate between each funnel stage (% From Stage N to N+1) depending on specific categories (Weather, Menu Categories), and analyzing points of funnel drop-off for both ordering platforms.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzing hourly (peak vs non-peak service times), weekly, and quarterly conversion rates to pinpoint lulls in customer full-funnel completion. Furthermore, includes daily weather forecasts to find any potential correlation with weather status and checkout completion.

### The following Project Deliverables will be provided:

- **Data Cleaning Notebook** documenting cleaning logic, documentation, and SQL queries used during cleaning. Furthermore, a final view will be created within the database for analysis.
- **Analysis Notebook** for answering established business questions as per the two insight areas above, showing analysis processes, SQL Queries, and brief notes on data outcomes.
- **Executive Summary and Recommendations** (this README.md file) to provide a summary of data findings, insights, and recommendations for industry stakeholders for further decision-making.
