# Project Background

A Vancouver-based Restaurant 'Red Ember House' relies on Online Ordering apps, such as UberEats and Doordash, for a significant portion of sales. However, a majority of customers never complete an order, and fall off at some point in the funnel. Using SQL and Tableau, I determine where the falloff happens in the funnel and what the causes it.
